*** Source file is c64ram.tt4 . Device is M5LV-256/68-7YC .

<Note>  z35109:  For this device, all input pairing is ignored since input
                 registers or latches do not exist. All signals must pass
                 through the central switch matrix before being latched or
                 registered.
<Note>  z40016:  0 pins have been reserved out of 72 .
<Note>  z40021:  72 pins are available after reservation, 48 are required
                 by the design.
<Note>  z35065:  For outputs, implicit output enables will be set to VCC.
<Warning>  z35064:  Output signal nIRQ has output enable set to GND.
<Warning>  z35064:  Output signal nDMA has output enable set to GND.
