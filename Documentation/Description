The GW4301A RAM expansion card provides the 
Commodore 64, 64C, and 128 with 2 MB of 
geoRAM-compatible expansion memory. 


Compact Size, Low Power Consumption
----------------------------------------
The GW4301A RAM expansion card is small enough to 
fit into a "stumpy" sized C64 cartridge, 
but provides 2 MB of geoRAM-compatible memory. 
Power consumption is minimized through the use 
of a single 16 megabit DRAM chip.


Optional Cartridge Case Available
----------------------------------------
GW4301A is optionally available with a 
transparent, TFW8b-brand cartridge casing. 
The TWF8b cartridge is well-manufactured 
and feels nice, especially compared to 
3d-printed cases. Although GW4301A is 
compatible with other cartridge cases,
we recommend the TFW8b case, available either 
with the purchase of a GW4301A card 
or _through TFW8b directly_. 


Open-Source Design
----------------------------------------
GW4301A's design is fully open-source. 
The schematics, board layouts, 
and CPLD firmware are all freely available 
for commercial and noncommercial use.
